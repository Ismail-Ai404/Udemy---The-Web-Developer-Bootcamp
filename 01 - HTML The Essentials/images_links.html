          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
               Wolves are the largest members of the dog family. They are highly
               social animals that live in packs, which are usually composed of
               a breeding pair and their offspring. Wolves are known for their
               keen senses, particularly their sense of smell, which is about
               100 times more sensitive than that of humans.
