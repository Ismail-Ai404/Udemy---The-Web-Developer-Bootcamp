          <h1>Let's Play With Flexbox</h1>
          <h2>Shrink, Grow and Basis</h2>
          <h3>Shrink</h3>
          <p>
               The <strong>flex-shrink</strong> property defines the ability for
               a flex item to shrink if necessary. It accepts a unitless value
               that serves as a proportion. For example, if one item has a
               flex-shrink of 1 and another has a flex-shrink of 2, the second
               item will shrink twice as much as the first one. Can be used by
               code <code>flex-shrink: 2</code>
          </p>
          <h3>Grow</h3>
          <p>
               The <strong>flex-grow</strong> property defines the ability for a
               flex item to grow if necessary. It also accepts a unitless value
               that serves as a proportion. For example, if one item has a
               flex-grow of 1 and another has a flex-grow of 2, the second item
               will grow twice as much as the first one. Can be used by code
               <code>flex-grow: 2</code>
          </p>
          <h3>Basis</h3>
          <p>
               The <strong>flex-basis</strong> property defines the default size
               of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can
               be set to a specific length (like px, em, etc.) or a percentage.
               If set to auto, it will use the element's width or height
               property. Can be used by code <code>flex-basis: 200px</code>
          </p>

          <section id="container">
               <div style="background-color: #80ffdb"></div>
               <div style="background-color: #64dfdf"></div>
               <div style="background-color: #48bfe3"></div>
               <div style="background-color: #5390d9"></div>
               <div style="background-color: #6930c3"></div>
          </section>
          <p></p>

          <h2>Another Example</h2>
          <p>
               In this example, we will create a layout with three sections: two
               sidebars and one main content area. The sidebars will have a
               <strong>flex-grow</strong> of 1, meaning they will grow equally
               to fill the available space, while the main content area will
               have a <strong>flex-grow</strong> of 2, meaning it will take up
               twice as much space as each sidebar. The
               <strong>flex-shrink</strong> will be set to 1 for maincontent and
               2 for sidebars, meaning the sidebars will shrink proportionally
               more than the main content area if the container becomes smaller.
               The <strong>flex-basis</strong> will be set to 800px for the main
               content area and 300px for each sidebar, meaning the main content
               area will start with a width of 800px and each sidebar will start
               with a width of 300px. The final CSS will look like this:
               <code>display: flex</code> on the container, and then
               <code>flex:2 1 800px</code> for main content and
               <code>flex:1 2 300px</code> for sidebars.
          </p>
          <main>
               <section class="sidebar"></section>
               <section class="maincontent"></section>
               <section class="sidebar"></section>
          </main>
          <p>
               Here is another example of Flexbox with different properties
               applied to the sidebar and main content sections. To apply
               Flexbox properties, you can use the following CSS:
               <code>flex: 1 2 30px</code> where the first number is the
               <strong>flex-grow</strong>, the second is the
               <strong>flex-shrink</strong>, and the third is the
               <strong>flex-basis</strong>.
          </p>
